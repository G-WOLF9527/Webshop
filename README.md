# Webshop
Very first vanilla JS project

Yeah I know I have to refactor it and do some issue repair like I did before ("Cart bug fix").
But I really don't want to touch my code anymore, because this is my first project and I want to track my progress in learning.

Not a template job what everyone done before me.
I don't get any help in this so I did everything by myself.

When I upload this project I seen what i did before and I said "Oh my god! I can do this and this and this better."
But I rly want to share this too, because I start with this.

Later I will rewrite this project in another version, but I don't refactor it.


And yeah... I realized when I coding I have to use comments... much more comments.
